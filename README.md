# Crowd-sourced-Employee-Evaluation-System

This is a semester project that I have done while I was studying for my BSc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. It was as a prototype system for evaluating employees based on user's or customers ratings and input.

# Objective
## General Objective
To build a system that makes employees of an organization perform competently in their position for the sake of their social status and reward. On the contrary, it also helps to create a system where employees that don’t perform their duty accordingly gets accountable for their action.
## Specific Objective
- Using this system every employee of a government organization is obligated to have a profile that is public where users can view, rate, and comment on the service that the employee provide consequently giving the authority to evaluate the performance of that employee based on the customers feedback and rewarding the employee if he/she is working at the expense of customer satisfaction or punishing if he/she is working at the expense of his/her benefit. Which makes the system accountable and actionable.
- Since all the comment given for that specific employee Is also public and can be viewed by other users this creates transparency which allows the user/customer know how he is going to be served in advance.
- Once reviews are collected and ratings are averaged service providers like salesman, managers, teachers, security, and so on can have a pay raise or bonus according to the companies scale. This motivates all service providers including the non rewarded one’s to get motivated to work more which intern giving an overall great service.
- In Social media, a user can comment on other users posts, like their posts, and engage in additional social activities and consequently users post new pictures, videos and articles to get other users attention and gets happy when their post is accepted by the society for this kind of social online reward people engage more and more with a better content on the social media. Bringing this social media aspect for evaluating employees motivates the employee to perform better In his position as of the social media.
